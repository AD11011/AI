# oUR-voices-will-be-heard
explian why I create this: platform with the all the infomation & resources you need to deal with discrimination. To record all incidents so that we do not just forget as time goes.(Ongoing and in the past). To let ppl know they are not alone.


# What to do when you encounter discrimination in any form 

# Why you should report the incident 

For youself
--- 
Reporting incidents is to protect **your own safety**.


For the whole community
---
Reporting a incident is not only for yourself, but also for the good of our whole community. If one racist gets away without punishments, it will set a bad example for many.
So we strongly encourage you to stand up and speak out, your brave action will contribute to our diversity, and help end racism which affects every single one of us.

It violates laws, university policies and values

# What to avoid after you encounter discrimation/assault
- It is advised to avoid contact with the person or group of people who initiated the act of discrimination or assault unless absolutely necessary. 
- If you find yourself in a situation where the person who initiated the act of discrimination, it is important to have a University official and/or someone you trust present. This way there is at least one witness present in case information needs to be confirmed later on. 
- You don't owe your offender any of your time to hear out their explanations. It is possible they will try to make you feel guilty for your involvement in the situation or coerce you to do something you don't want to do.
