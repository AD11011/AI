# What to avoid after you encounter discrimation/assault
- It is advised to avoid contact with the person or group of people who initiated the act of discrimination or assault unless absolutely necessary. 
- If you find yourself in a situation where the person who initiated the act of discrimination, it is important to have a University official and/or someone you trust present. This way there is at least one witness present in case information needs to be confirmed later on. 
- You don't owe your offender any of your time to hear out their explanations. It is possible they will try to make you feel guilty for your involvement in the situation or coerce you to do something you don't want to do.
